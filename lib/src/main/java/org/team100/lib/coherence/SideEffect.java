 * For example, when the vision reader does its thing, there's no simple output
 * to cache, only mutations to the pose history, which can be picked up by
 * querying the history itself. Use this class to represent the action that
 * should be refreshed.
 * 
 * Note: it's generally better to avoid side effects if you can.
